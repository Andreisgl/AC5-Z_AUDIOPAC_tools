///SS2 to NSPF "converter"
========================== by death_the_d0g

About:
------
A script that will take SS2 (Sony PS2 Compressed ADPCM) files and "convert them" to the audio format ACZ uses (NSPF, Namco Sound Production File?).

Not a converter, this script will simply take a SS2 file, read its stream data, add a custom header then export it to the NSPF format so it can be read by the game.


Requirements:
-------------
- Have Python version 3.8.5 or newer installed in your computer.

- Your custom music files converted to the SS2 format.


Usage:
------
Run the script and follow the instructions shown in the screen. Once you've input the required information the script will create a new NSPF file.

Rename this file with the name of the track you want to replace and drop it in the BGM folder, then run the "ACZ BGMPAC repacker" to generate a new BGM.PAC file.


Notes:
------
This script was intended to work with music files only. It might be possible to also mod other audio files such as voice lines but I don't guarantee it will work and I will neither offer support for this.
